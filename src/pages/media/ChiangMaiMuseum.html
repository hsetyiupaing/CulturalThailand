                    The Chiang Mai Cultural Centre was created to help local people understand the city’s historical importance. 
                    It was also created to help them understand their roots and foster a sense of pride in local identity, 
                    and thus to help preserve the beauty of local customs and culture. In addition, the centre contributes to 
                    conservational tourism by preserving the heritage of the old city centre and giving visitors the opportunnity
                    to know and understand the city of Chiang Mai. The permanent exhibitons are the matically divided into periods 
                    and topics which are shown in 15 rooms. They show the development of the region and the city from pre-history
                    to its rise and decline as an independent capital. The city’s history is illustrated up until present times.

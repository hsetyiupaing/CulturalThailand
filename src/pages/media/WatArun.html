                Wat Arun, also known as the Temple of Dawn, is one of Bangkok’s most iconic landmarks located on the west bank 
                of the Chao Phraya River in Thailand. The temple is famous for its towering central spire, or prang, decorated 
                with colorful porcelain and seashells that sparkle in the sunlight. Wat Arun is a symbol of the rising sun and 
                represents the birth of a new era.Visitors can climb the steep central spire to enjoy panoramic views of the river, 
                nearby temples, and the city skyline. The temple grounds feature beautifully landscaped gardens, smaller spires, 
                and intricate statues that showcase traditional Thai craftsmanship. Wat Arun is particularly stunning during 
                sunrise and sunset when its reflective surfaces create a breathtaking sight.

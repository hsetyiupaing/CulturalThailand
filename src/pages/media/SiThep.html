                Si Thep Historical Park is an archaeological site located in Phetchabun Province, Thailand. 
                It preserves the ruins of an ancient town that dates back to the Dvaravati period, roughly between 
                the 6th and 11th centuries. The park includes remnants of city walls, moats, temples, and religious 
                monuments, showcasing early urban planning and Buddhist cultural influence in central Thailand. Visitors 
                can walk among the well-preserved ruins, admire ancient Buddha images and sculptures, and explore 
                the on-site museum that displays artifacts such as pottery, tools, and religious objects. The park 
                provides insight into early Thai civilization, highlighting the artistry, spirituality, and daily 
                life of the people who once lived there. It is both an educational and visually striking destination 
                for history enthusiasts and tourists.

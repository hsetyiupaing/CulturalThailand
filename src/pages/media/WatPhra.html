                Wat Pho, officially called Wat Phra Chetuphon Wimon Mangkhalaram Rajwaramahawihan, is a first-class royal monastery and one of Thailand’s most important temples, located south of the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Originally an old Ayutthaya-era temple named Wat Phodharam, it was restored by King Rama I in 1788 and later expanded by King Rama III, who added the famous Reclining Buddha, Phra Mondob (library hall), and teaching halls. The temple served as a center for Thai art, education, and traditional medicine, reflecting the dedication of skilled craftsmen and monks during its construction. Wat Pho holds the ashes of King Rama I beneath its main Buddha image and stands today as a major landmark known for its stunning architecture, rich history, and role in preserving Thai cultural heritage.

                Sukhothai rose as a city-state between the 19th and 21st Buddhist Era, located along the basins of the Yom, Ping, Nan, Moei, and Pa Sak rivers, between the Pagan Kingdom in the west and Khmer Kingdom in the east. Archaeological evidence, such as stone tools, human skeletons, beads, bronze wares, and silver coins, shows continuous settlement from the 18th B.E., with relations to Dvaravati-based states. Khmer cultural influence persisted through sites like Prang Puja and Ta Pha Daeng Shrine. In the 18th B.E., King Jayavarman VII of Khmer shifted to Mahayana Buddhism, influencing art and architecture in Thailand, seen in sites like Prang Sam Yod, Prang Wat Phra Si Mahathat, and Prasart Wat Phra Pai Luang.

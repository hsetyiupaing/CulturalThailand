                    In 1782 the new King decided to move the capital city to the left bank of the Chao Phraya River for strategic purposes and 
                    used the canals to the west as defenses for the new city. A palace was constructed whose grounds currently covers an area of 
                    218,000 square metres that are enclosed by crenallated walls measuring 19,000 metres. Similar to palaces in the former capitals 
                    of Sukhothai and Ayudhaya this palace is also laid out with Halls of Residence and Throne Halls as well as administrative buildings
                    and a temple that serves as the Chapel Royal.
